\section{SELF NOTES FOR MY RECORD}

\subsection{Is the nature Lorentz Invariance ?}
This is just I found in media, and I write here just to have it and in future read more about it. This is not part of the notes.\\

\subsection{Black Rings in $5$-dimention}

The Neutral Black Ring in $5$-dimention EMD theory has been given by [R. Emparan, JHEP. 03 (2004) 064]:

\begin{align}
   ds^2 =& -\frac{F(y)}{F(x)}\left(dt - C(\nu,\lambda)R\frac{1+y}{F(y)}d\psi\right)^2 \nonumber\\
         & ~ \frac{R^2}{(x-y)^2}F(x)\left[-\frac{G(y)}{F(y)}d\psi^2 - \frac{dy^2}{G(y)} + \frac{dx^2}{G(x)} + \frac{G(x)}{F(x)}d\phi^2\right]
\end{align}

where

\begin{align}
   F(\xi) = 1 + \lambda\xi \quad , \quad G(\xi) = (1-\xi^2)(1+\nu\xi) \nonumber\\
   G(\nu,\lambda) = \sqrt{\lambda(\lambda-\nu)\frac{1+\lambda}{1-\lambda}}
\end{align}

The parameter $\lambda$ and $\nu$ are dimentionless abd takes values in the range $(0<\nu\leq\lambda<1)$, and to avoid the conical singularity also at $x=1$, $\lambda$ and $\nu$ must be related to each other via $\lambda = 2\nu/(1+\nu^2)$. The coordinate $\phi$ and $\psi$ are two cycles of the black ring, and $x$ and $y$ takes the range as $-1\leq x \leq 1$ and $-\infty\leq y \leq -1$. The constant $R$ has the dimentional of length and for thin large rings correspondes roughly to the radius of the ring circule [H. Elvlang, Phys. Rev. D68 (2008) 124016]. The horizon is loceted at $y=y_h=-1/\nu$. The mass of the black ring is $M = 3\pi R^2\lambda/4[1-\nu]$, and its angular momentum takes $J = \pi R^3\sqrt{\lambda(\lambda-\nu)(1+\lambda)}/[2(1-\nu)^2]$. In addition, the spacetime contains three Killing coordinate $t$, $\phi$, and $\psi$.
